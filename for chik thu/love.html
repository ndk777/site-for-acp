Mei", let Koe" tell you something nor.

Koe" doesn't like selling anything kwr
I have never been the type to give things away ‚Äî not even little stuff.

Cuz once something becomes mine, there's always a bond.
Even when I was young, if it rained, I would worry if my toys were getting cold.
That‚Äôs just how I have always been.

Once something is Mine, it becomes loved.
Even if it breaks, even if it stops working, I still keep it ‚Äî because it's mine, and I love it.

Back in my 3tan aywl, I had a lil toy.
Someone else wanted it, so I gave it to him.
But later, I couldn‚Äôt stop thinking ‚Äî
"Would it really be happy in someone else‚Äôs hands?"

I felt so much regret.
Because when something is mine, it has meaning.
Even toys ‚Äî after playing, I would carefully put them away, safe and sound.

And everyone knows‚Ä¶ I love my cats so much.
Feed them, hold them, take care of them like my family.

But Mei"‚Ä¶ do you know why Koe" named my cat Meimei?

Because I always wanted to be with you.
Always.

So I gave your name to the one who stays beside me day and night.

It was my small way of being close to you.
Even when you‚Äôre far, I could say your name, call you, hug you ‚Äî through Meimei.

Just a little hope‚Ä¶ that even when we're apart, I could still feel you near.

So think about it, Mei" ‚Äî
If I love my cat that much‚Ä¶
How much do you think Koe" loves Mei"?

To me, Mei ka koe" pai sai tha mhya htl mhr tan foe ashi sone, koe" tan foe ahtr sone nae koe" achit sone lyy ly nor.

So no‚Ä¶ You are not someone I would ever give to anyone.
You are the most precious treasure I have, and I will always think of you that way ‚Äî with pride and with love byr
