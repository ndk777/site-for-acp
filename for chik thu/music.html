You  
Hmm, yeah  
This is my decision, decision  
This is my decision  
I don't think you listen, you listen  
I don't think you listen  
For me to come out, it must mean I'm at the door  
It must mean I'm not the same  
It must mean I'm on your case  
For me to come out, it means that I'm at the door  
I want to show you my world  
Give me one break, I need faith  
Faith to believe you, faith to receive you  
Give me something I'm lacking  
I don't need nothing  
You are my everything  
Only me and you, only me and you (you)  
Only me and you, only me and you  
Only me, only you  
Only me and you (you)  
Only me and you  
Only me and you, only me and you  
Make me your matter  
Make me your matter  
Make me your matter  
Show me your substance  
Make me your person  
Make me your person  
Give me one break, I need faith  
Faith to believe you, faith to receive you  
Give me something I'm lacking  
I don't need nothing  
You are my everything  
Only me and you, only me and you (you)  
Only me and you, only me and you  
Only me, only you  
Only me and you (you)  
Only me and you  
Only me and you, only me and you  
All I want, only me and you  
All I want, only me and you  
All I want, only me and you  
All I want, only me and you  
Only me and you, me and you (me and you)  
Only me and you (me and you)  
Only me and you  
Only me and, me and, and you (me and you)  
Only me and you (me and you)  
Only me and you  
Only me and, me and, and you
